## What's actually in the Last Light mod?

This mod has one central mechanic:

## Wither:
"While Wither is applied, Weak, Vulnerable, and Poison will not decrease."

These are all cards for The Silent. I am looking at starting to work on The Ironclad. Thsi doesn't mean I think The Silent is done. This is still WIP so feedback is greatly appreciated.
